1.	Importing the LinearRegression Class: Before this code snippet, you would typically have imported the LinearRegression class from the sklearn.linear_model module. This class implements linear regression, a method used to predict the value of a target variable based on one or more predictor variables (features).
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

2.	Creating an Instance of the Model:
regressor = LinearRegression()
•	What Happens Here:
	This line creates an instance of the LinearRegression class and assigns it to the variable regressor.
	At this point, the regressor is just a blueprint of the linear regression model. It hasn’t been trained yet and does not have any learned parameters.

3.	Fitting the Model:
python
regressor.fit(X_train, y_train)
•	What Happens Here:
	The fit method is called on the regressor object. This is where the actual training of the linear regression model occurs.
•	Parameters:
 X_train: This is the feature matrix containing the independent variables used for prediction (e.g., Revenue and Expenses).
 y_train: This is the target variable (dependent variable) you want to predict (e.g., Profit).
•	Training Process:
	During the fitting process, the linear regression model tries to learn the relationship between the features in X_train and the target variable in y_train.
	The model computes the best-fit line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) that minimizes the difference (error) between the predicted values and the actual values of y_train.
	This is typically done using the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method, which minimizes the sum of the squared residuals (the difference between the actual and predicted values).
	Mathematically, the relationship can be represented as: y=β0+β1⋅X1+β2⋅X2+…+βn⋅Xny = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot X_1 + \beta_2 \cdot X_2 + \ldots + \beta_n \cdot X_ny=β0+β1⋅X1+β2⋅X2+…+βn⋅Xn Where:
 	yyy is the target variable (Profit).
	β0\beta_0β0 is the intercept.
	β1,β2,…,βn\beta_1, \beta_2, \ldots, \beta_nβ1,β2,…,βn are the coefficients for each feature X1,X2,…,XnX_1, X_2, \ldots, X_nX1,X2,…,Xn (Revenue and Expenses).

4.	Result of Fitting:
	After calling fit, the regressor object will have learned the coefficients (slopes) and intercept needed to make predictions about the target variable based on the input features.
	You can access these learned parameters using:
regressor.coef_  # Coefficients for each feature
regressor.intercept_  # The intercept

5.  Summary:
•	Objective: The purpose of this code snippet is to train a linear regression model using a dataset that includes independent variables (features) and a dependent variable (target).
•	Outcome: After executing this code, you will have a trained linear regression model (regressor) that can now be used to make predictions on new data or to evaluate how well it performs on the test data. The model has learned how changes in the features (Revenue and Expenses) are associated with changes in the target variable (Profit).

6  Once the model is trained, you typically follow this with predictions and evaluations:
•	Predictions: You can use the model to make predictions on unseen data using:
predictions = regressor.predict(X_test)

7  Model Evaluation: To assess the model’s performance, you might use metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or R-squared.
	MAE is easier to interpret because it's in the same units as the target variable.
	MSE and RMSE are useful when you want to penalize larger errors more.
	RMSE is the most commonly used metric because it balances the benefits of MSE (penalizing large errors) while retaining the interpretability of MAE (same units as the target).
