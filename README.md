# Predicting-a-company-s-financial-outcomes-using-ML
Predicting a company's financial outcomes, such as P & L statements and quarterly/annual results, using a machine learning approach. We can utilize a linear regression model as a starting point.
Predict a financial outcomes based on historical financial documents produced by various stakeholders, such as revenue reports, expense reports, and other relevant documents. Summary of the Project
•	Problem: Predicting a company's profit based on revenue and expenses.
•	Method: We used linear regression to establish relationships between revenue, expenses, and profit.
•	Key Insights: As revenue increases, profit tends to increase, while high expenses can negatively impact profit.
•	Evaluation: Model performance was assessed using MAE, MSE, and RMSE to understand how well the predictions match actual values
•	plot(): Used for line plots (connecting points with lines), best for continuous data.
•	scatter(): Used for scatter plots (discrete data points), best for showing relationships or distributions between variables.
